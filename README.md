# Remote Tech Job Skill Analyzer

This Python program automatically analyzes remote job listings from RSS or XML feeds to detect and summarize the most common technical skills, job titles, soft skills, benefits and seniority levels requested across multiple listings.

It does not rely on a fixed keyword list, and instead uses NLP techniques to responsively detect patterns and trends.
