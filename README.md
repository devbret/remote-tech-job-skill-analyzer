# Remote Tech Job Skill Analyzer

This Python program automatically analyzes remote job listings from RSS or XML files to detect and summarize the most common technical skills, job titles, soft skills, benefits and seniority levels requested across multiple listings.

It does not rely on a fixed keyword list, and instead uses NLP techniques to responsively detect patterns and trends.

It also includes a streaming integration with the Anthropic Claude API, allowing the tool to generate high-level strategic analyses about the job market based on the extracted data. This report offers actionable advice for both job seekers and hiring managers.

The script is ideal for anyone studying hiring trends, designing tech job boards or refining their job-seeking strategy. It can be easily modified to support additional data sources, analysis types or skill taxonomies. Results are saved to a structured JSON file and supplemented by an AI-generated plain-text report.
